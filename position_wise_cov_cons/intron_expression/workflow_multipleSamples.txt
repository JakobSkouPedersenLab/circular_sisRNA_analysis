## Running HTSeq-count ##

# Looping over every sample (bash) and running HTSeq-count
cd /output/path # also path where BAM files are stored, e.g., /output/path/sample1/sample1.bam
while read sample 
do
    sbatch /path/HTSeq_gene_count.sh ${sample} 
done < input.lst


# The input.lst contains the sample name.
# Basic structure of the input.lst:
sample1  
sample2 
sample3

# Process output
# Use ./defining_intron_loci/create_intron_bed_gtf.Rmd to create GTF file with non-overlapping intron annotations (used in /path/HTSeq_gene_count.sh).
# Use ./intron_counts_output.R to generate an aggregated expression matrix and annotation tables
