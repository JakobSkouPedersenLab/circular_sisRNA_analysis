## Obtaining strand-specific read-coverage from BAM files ##

# Note that exon-intron reads are not removed (from pre-mRNA or alternative splicing), which is to match the Htseq approach (for whole-intron expression).
# This workflow aims to generate an overview of the total, cross-sample, normalized read-coverage.

# Steps:

# 1) Create list of sample names, here named ./sampleIDs.txt. Format:
sample1
sample2
sample3
# Some of the annotation files used (e.g., containing intron coordinates) can be generated using ./defining_intronloci/create_intron_bed_gtf.Rmd.

# 2) Filter reads not mapping to intronic loci and remove linear splice-reads (mapping across introns) using samtools view and BEDtools intersect. Then generate bigWig file using bamCoverage. This is done for each sample running the following bash code in the terminal:
cd /path/to/folder/containing/BAM/files
while read sample
do
    sbatch /path/coverage_intron_stranded.sh ${sample}
done < /path/sampleIDs.txt

# 3) Merge bigWig (bw) files from all samples using wiggletools and bedGraphToBigWig, by running the ./coverage_bw_merge.sh script.
sbatch /path/coverage_bw_merge.sh

# 4) Use bwtools to extract read-coverage for each intron (this step can also be used for downloaded conservation/phyloP-score tracks).
sbatch /path/coverage_intron_extract.sh

# 5) Normalize .bw and .bedGraph files as counts per million (CPM; I used the total reads across all samples for normalization) and per sample (divide by total number of samples). Then extract per base read-depth/conservation scores of specific regions of interest (e.g., 5' splice site, branch point, 3' splice site). This helps reduce the final file size.
